# Rate My CAPEs

When choosing classes, professor review websites are some of the only tools that students can rely on to plan their school year.
Although ratings may be accurate, they are not informative on why some professors are rated higher than others. For example, one professor may teach well but have low ratings for their difficult exams, and vice versa. This type of information can only be expressed in the written reviews that students leave along with their rating.

To get a wholistic review of a professor, students must read through each review listed under a professor. To help eliminate this tedious task, we created Rate My CAPEs for the students at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).

Rate My CAPEs combines professor review website RateMyProfessors and CAPEs, UCSD's professor rating tool. The program runs sentiment analysis on each review of a professor and lists the most prevalent opinions felt by their students. Combining these labels with the overall numerical ratings on the two sites, Rate My CAPEs is able to give a more accurate and accessible professor review.
