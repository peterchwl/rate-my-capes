BUT he will randomly select 10% of the people at the end of the session for an interview of about 30 minutes!!! If you don't attend the interview, the grade will not be reported. Highly do not recommend this class! :  satisfied\n",
            "One of my favorite professors in UCSD. His CSE 11, 12, and 100 are somewhat harder than other professors, but doable. You would learn a lot. :  satisfied\n",
            "One of the best CSE profs I've had so far. His lectures consist of introducing the topic and providing a lot of examples/questions to help develop your understanding of the material. He definitely cares about his students. His PA's weren't too hard but his quizzes were pretty tricky which can be tough at times. Great prof, definitely take him. :  satisfied\n",
            "My favorite CSE professor at UCSD.  :  happy\n",
            "Coding is awful. The prof is cool but why assign all these other assignments, readings, and homeworks, if we are just going to forget it or not be tested on it. :  satisfied\n",
            "The professor taught content well, but a lot of times I felt it was completely unnecessary to go to lecture since he always assigned a huge amount of pre-lecture reading, that covered everything he was going to teach. After doing the reading, lecture just felt repetitive. :  dissatisfied\n",
            "Definitively one of the best CSE professors in UCSD.  :  satisfied\n",
            "This class is doable even if you have no experience in coding, like me. the PAs were kind of hard, but starting early and going to tutoring actually helped a lot. There are a lot of components to the final grade so even if you bomb a test it is possible to still do fine in the class. Overall, pretty good and simple class even if u dislike coding. :  satisfied\n",
            "gives extra credits and curve! :  satisfied\n",
            "One thing to say: DO YOUR PAs EARLY! Paul's PAs were quite fun, though it took some time to fully understand it. Otherwise, it's mostly using techniques we learnt in class. I enjoyed the way Paul taught CSE8A, it was very engaging with the constant questions to test your understanding of the material. I would take another class with Paul! :  satisfied\n",
            "Solid professor for CSE 12. Tests and PAs were fair.  :  satisfied\n",
            "Really tough class for people without any previous coding experience. Prof. Cao is a strict person with indifferent attitude. His lectures are so confusing, and extremely hard to apply what we learned in class to the weekly programming assignments. :  dissatisfied\n",
            "Paul is such a caring professor. I had no comp sci experience and went in completely blind, but he clearly puts in a lot of effort when it comes to teaching. He took to the time to create and pass out worksheets just so everyone could follow along. Complete all the assignments and you should be fine. :  satisfied\n",
            "Professor Cao was the best professor I had in Fall 2021. I found the lectures to be clear, interesting, and engaging. Midterms and Final were fairly easy. PAs were great in further establishing coding concepts as well as your own skills :  satisfied\n",
            "I took CSE 8A with professor Cao this quarter. I had no prior experience with python, and professor Cao was able to make learning this language clear and simple. He is very funny and uses good examples. The hardest part of the class is the PAs, make sure you start early and make use of tutor hours! The TA tutors are extremely helpful. :  satisfied\n",
            "we did python for 8A this quarter. Generally speaking, this class is easy A. :  neutral\n",
            "Do not take him!!!!!! He is been hyped!!!! His PAs are so hard and usually take one day to finish it and you will feel like you are tortured by the PAs mentally. The quizzes are tricky. His explanations and hints of the PAs are useless. Do not take him unless you like your mind suffering from torture once a week!!!! :  happy\n",
            "Cao is an amazing teacher. Just make sure to start early on the PAs so that you will be able to get help from autograder tutors. You will need it. Don't expect to do well in the course if you start the night of or the night before. Make sure you study for the midterms and finals (go over all quizzes, pas, and lectures). STAY CAUGHT UP ON LECTURES! :  happy\n",
            "Paul is a really nice professor and he explains things well. He would use real life examples that are easy to understand to explain hard concepts. Took 8B and 12 with him and learned a great deal from his classes. PAs are time consuming but it's worth the time to do it. :  satisfied\n",
            "Paul is very funny and explains the material clearly. Programming assignments can be overwhelming at times, but they are clearly explained and structured. They can be too structured at times though, sometimes there's little thought involved. Textbook work is mandatory, but I found it easy and also very useful. :  satisfied\n",
            "Cao is really good at explaining concepts that could be really tough to understand otherwise. The PAs were time-consuming but they definitely helped solidify my knowledge. During our quarter, he co-taught the class with Greg Miranda, so they had the same lectures, assignments, and exams - which seems like it will be a theme going forward. :  satisfied\n",
            "His lectures are very informative as his solid understanding allows him to effectively explain many concepts. The PAs get to be pretty time consuming, but there is always help available. Lectures were not mandatory but were very helpful. Readings are also pretty helpful. Prior experience in CS really helps reduce the workload. :  satisfied\n",
            "Terrible Professor. Workloads are insane, and PAs are hard, confusing and tricky. Lots of hidden cases that are very hard to think about. Average of PAs grade are around 85-90%. Tests are very trick and test more on the concept rather than code. Test are open everything but the average is 80%. No extra credit. DONT TAKE HIM. :  satisfied\n",
            "He was alright. He seemed to have a direct grasp of the knowledge and he answered most of the questions that students had but he did overlook some stuff that made the PAs harder than it needed to be and his final was hard compared to what he gave for the midterm. Overall, solid prof but do not be surprised by harder than usual exams. :  satisfied\n",
            "Professor Cao taught me data structures and it was wonderful. The PAs are directly related to the material of the lecture. Overall a wonderful experience. :  satisfied\n",
            "Spent 3 quarters with Paul. Definitely a great prof! Always get wonderful grades by the end of the quarters! Lectures are amazing with insightful contents. :  satisfied\n",
            "HE IS THE BEST. He cares about students and going to his office hours helps so much. And most importantly, he explains concepts with easy examples, which make so much more sense than just reading off the textbook. :  satisfied\n",
            "I took his CSE8B and CSE100. One of the best professors in CSE Department. You really learn A LOT from his lectures. PAs are time consuming but worth doing them. Hope he can teach some upper division courses and I will definitely take them. :  satisfied\n",
            "Highly recommend if you really wanna learn something. His assignment could be quite hellish if you have no previous experience in programming, but are pretty helpful. And most of all, he's lectures are always helpful with a lot of details, and he explains the material quite well. :  satisfied\n",
            "Paul is one of the best CSE lecturers/professors at UCSD. He is really good at explaining materials. His PAs are hard but as long as you spend time on them, you will learn a looot from them. :  happy\n",
            "Worst Professor I have taken so far . Workloads are insane, tests are meant to trick you with tiny descriptive language, during office hours hes very intimidating and will talk down to you not very helpful at all!. His podcasts lack details and he just talks in terrible monotone. Reading Quiz due every class meeting . Not lenient by any means. :  dissatisfied\n",
            "Pros: podcast available, reasonable exams, explain concepts super well, take advice from students, iclicker discussion Cons: bursting workload of PAs, there are times when I spent tons of time and effort on one PA yet still get horrible grade (might bc i'm dumb af), he sound strict and mean at times but doesn't hurt :  satisfied\n",
            "Hellish workload. Midterms and final were CSE-level, not too difficult. But the PA were difficult and lengthy, easily 20 hours a week. Fixed somewhat after multiple Piazza and TA requests. PA grading was strict (examining output) because expected in future upperCSE, but killed my grades. Professor was fine, but curved grades indicated difficulty. :  satisfied\n",
            "Professor Cao is one of my favorite professors at UCSD, and I definitely learned a lot in this course. He cares about preparing students for the industry, and he's very reasonable. If you're good at computer science or are willing to put in the work, this class should be very fun and fairly easy. :  satisfied\n",
            "grading is unreasonable, prof do not take suggestions and doesnt care about student concerns. Need to spend long time to do the PA especially in the beginning of the quarter. Exams are not very hard but not as easy as the practice. Overall lecture is fine, you learn a lot. Worst cse prof in my entire college life :  satisfied\n",
            "He gives out really simple past/sample exams, but then increase the difficulty by a lot during the actual exam. He also doesn't take suggestions from students very often. But aside from those, cool guy. :  satisfied\n",
            "The worst professor I've ever seen. He doesn't take students' advices or concerns. I'm literally kicked off from his office when trying to tell him what's wrong with the course. He's not caring enough to be a professor. His PAs are not hard to finish, but hard to understand. 20+h to understand the requirements from piazza, and 10h actual coding.:) :  dissatisfied\n",
            "CSE8A and CSE8B thought by him are really fun. You can finish many interesting programs even though you are just a beginner. However, his CSE100 is hard and he is trying to make harder. Even though exams are easy, PAs take over 24 hours and you may not make it correct. I suggest to take CSE8A/B with him but dont take CSE100 with him!!! :  happy\n",
            "One of the best professors Ive had at UCSD. He really knows his stuff. I highly recommend you take his classes if you have the choice. The only slight drawback is that his accent can be a little bit difficult to understand at times. :  satisfied\n",
            "Cao was an inspiration teacher for CSE8. However the way he is managing CSE100 in intense. The workload is too much for PA1 and PA2 and students are spending countless hours on a waiting queue, but the tutors are changing to fix some difficulty. The PA write-ups are partially vague. His midterm and lectures are just like CSE8, but PA are hellish. :  satisfied\n",
            "PAs are not extremely difficult, but they are time consuming Lecture is mandatory, Caring for students and listen to feedback Exams are not hard once you get the concept, I barely passed the first quiz and midterm, and got 100% on final after spent a lot of time studying the past exams :  satisfied\n",
            "He does his best to keep their students on their toes but the teaching method was not very good. Attendance is mandatory because he will only hand out 'printed' class notes in class. Also don't even try to look for code snippets online, he will report you for Academic Integrity violation. Has heavy accent and difficult to understand. :  satisfied\n",
            "The final exam was 261 out of 236, and average was 236, literally 100 percent. I would highly recommend Paul if you want to learn CS well. The class is by no mean easy, but I definitely enjoy the material in cs30 :  satisfied\n",
            "Paul is a horrible professor. \"I want to conserve the integrity of UCSD \" his words, not mine. He upped the difficulty of this class as if it wasn't already difficult enough. Never taking him again. Rather wait a whole quarter if he's the only choice. :  satisfied\n",
            "If you go to the lectures and do the reading you will probably get the concept. He really explains things really well, the lecture is structural and clear. But the PAs are really time-consuming and tough, and you don't want to expect an extension. The quizzes and mid-term are tricky, I got a 50% on the midterm. The final is ok I got 100%. :  satisfied\n",
            "He really cares your learning and will take in student feedback. He would modify the class if the majority of the opinion reflected that they want the change. Awesome prof! :  satisfied\n",
            "One the best Professors at UCSD. :  satisfied\n",
            "His final is so tricky, and no curve. You need to spend millions of time to do his psa, but you still cannot make sure you get a good grade. I did really hard work, but I still cannot get an A rather than A-. :  happy\n",
            "The best way I can describe Paul is that he is a caring and very much a dad-figure to every one in the class. He makes it his goal to help you understand the rather confusing topics in Java and the in class examples (clicker questions) are incredibly helpful in demonstrating the nuances in the code. Do his quizzes on time and pay attention for an A :  satisfied\n",
            "Paul (Yingjun) knows what he is talking about and makes sure you understand. Reading quizzes three times per week and weekly programming assignments. The PA's can be time consuming and you will probably need help to complete them. 3 easy in-class quizzes. :  satisfied\n",
            "Paul (Yingjun) clearly knows what he is talking about and makes sure you do too. Reading quizzes three times per week, review quizzes and programming assignments due once per week. Weekly lab sections are useful. He has plenty of office hours and there are always tutors in the lab if you need help. :  satisfied\n",
            "If you want to learn Java, you should take this class. Paul (Yingjun) Cao goes into great depth explaining concepts, and will pause the lecture to expand on a concept if he feels that the class doesn't get a concept. Even though the PAs are time consuming, I found them relatively straightforward and educational. I did stuff last minute and got a B+ :  satisfied\n",
            "He explains things really well. You can understand him clearly even if you don't have any programming experience previously. The programming assignments are a little tough but you will really learn the concepts better after finishing them. Besides, most of the time the assignments are really fun. Good luck! :  satisfied\n",
            "Knows his stuff. Reading quizzes every alternate day, review quizzes every week. Additional PSAs due every week. Lectures are informative and count for a small percentage of final grade. :  satisfied\n",

            "A very good professor, can explain things very clear when you have a question. :  satisfied\n",
            "A fast paced class with too many quizzes and very difficult weekly assignments. Paul Cao is a caring professor who values feedback, but his class is just much too fast-paced especially for beginning coders. :  satisfied\n",
            "Paul Cao is a nice professor and tries really hard to make you understand the material, but the material itself is really difficult. There are too many quizzes that we have to take and you can never relax in the class because PSA's are due every week and they take forever to do. Midterm was hard. :  happy\n",
            "Prof. Cao is a well-respected teacher among all my friends. He is kind, accessible outside of class, and sometimes with unexpected humor. His course is well designed and well prepared. Follow his reading assignments, handouts, practice exams, programming assignments and lecture. You will find his assignments doable because he gets you ready. :  satisfied\n",
            "Professor Cao is a great instructor. He truly cares about your learning and will help you without judgement, especially on your exams. His lectures are a little hard to follow but he will slow down if you ask him to. There are quizzes during class but as long as you do your PSAs and attend lectures, you should be set. Studying is strongly recommend :  satisfied\n",
            "If you concentrate on lectures you won't need the book at all. You will get an easy A if you take him :  satisfied\n",

            "Professor Cao's class has been my favorite at ucsd so far. Attendance is mandatory, but I enjoyed his lectures. Exams were very fair. I appreciate that he asks for criticism and comments from his students to improve his own teaching. :  dissatisfied\n",
            "Overall a good professor. Exam and quiz got harder this quarter but you should be fine if you study and pay attention during lecture. :  satisfied\n",
            "Mr. Cao is a wonderful teacher. His lectures are very well structured, and deliver important information. There are reading quizzes due on the morning of each lecture, so reading is important. His class is not extremely difficult, but it isn't a catwalk. 10/10 would take again :  satisfied\n",
            "One of the best professor. True. The class is time consuming. Reading quizzes, PSA, but all the cse classes are. It is not his fault.  The class is not that hard if you just follow his step. Professor Can is approachable and inspiring. Clear in explaining concepts. I think the university should let him teach more cse classes. He really cares about :  satisfied\n",
            "Professor Cao is the best professor I've had at UCSD so far! His lectures are packed with valuable knowledge and material so going to lectures will definitely help your grade. All his PAs are explained very clearly and graded fairly as well. He's one of those professor where going to lecture is actually really worth it! Definitely recommend! :  satisfied\n",
            "This is the second class that I took with Professor Cao. In general, he is responsible that he uses podcasts and posts the slides online timely. However, he assumes too much knowledge you should know before class, and usually he doesn't explain very clear. His lecture has a lot of discussion which he could have spent those time lecturing. :  dissatisfied\n",
            "For those who claim Cao is not clear enough, I think  they won't find any  cs professor they like  in ucsd.  Take him, you will get an easy A and have solid cs fundation. :  satisfied\n",
            "Very veerrrry nice person!!! It is really my pleasure to meet such a nice CSE professor. The final is very identical to all the previous works we had done so far. He gives all the materials such as podcast, past papers, lecture slides notes, study guide, etc. You can prepare all well and develop a strong base of CSE. Take this prof!!! :  satisfied\n",
            "There's a lot of work in this class. (Labs, quizzes, homework, midterms) He posts everything online. He even posted the podcast of when we took our midterm, so it was a podcast of us staring at a watch for 80 minutes. But he is pretty good at explaining and he tries really hard. Getting a passing grade isn't hard, but you have to work for the A. :  happy\n",
            "Fun class, great professor. Never leaves anyone behind. :  happy\n",
            "Good prof.  Very clear and fair.  He challenges you to know material, but if you put in the effort and start hw early, you can definitely get an A. Just START EARLY and go to tutors for help and you are golden :  satisfied\n",
            "CSE 8B is harder than 8A, but you have so many chances to get extra credits. Problem Solving Assignments are more fun but more time-consuming. Get ready to devote a couple weekends to PSAs! :  happy\n",
            "Most would say accent is a problem, but it really is not. Attend lecture or watch podcast, and the tests would be chill. PAs will take time, especially pa2 (start wordcloud early). TA's are great. Tutors are great. In essence, he knows what he is doing. :  happy\n",
            "Wouldn't have been the same without Cao! He's able to explain concepts well and in a way that's easy to understand. Granted, there are certain topics that are just harder to grasp, but he genuinely cares for his students and how they are performing. Coding assignment range from really hard to easy, and quizzes and exams are not hard but not easy :  satisfied\n",
            "During my quarter, I believe that he gave an incredibly high number of quizzes. I think that 7 quizzes in 2 weeks is a bit too much. He was pretty unclear when he was explaining and I honestly learnt more from the internet than I did from him. Overall, I would not recommend this teacher based of this quarter's experiences. :  satisfied\n",
            "I think Professor Cao is a very passionate teacher, however, I didn't gain much from his class. There were a few too many quizzes, tests, and assignments that set the expectations for the class to be a bit higher than I could realistically achieve. Many students like him but I became disenfranchised rather quickly and would not take his class again :  satisfied\n",
            "I love Professor Cao! He explains everything very clearly and goes through each problem in detail even if no one asks (in case you're shy). There are lots of good examples&info in clicker questions that will help on projects! He's very kind with grading and extra help, and he takes time before class to just sit down and chat with students :) :  satisfied\n",
            "He is a nice professor. He explains things clearly and his tests are fair :  satisfied\n",
            "Professor Cao is super patient. However hard ur question is, he will answer u wiz a lot of details and make sure u understand it. :  happy\n",
            "His classes are interesting and the exams are not too hard. :  satisfied\n",
            "Awesome class. He was very clear and you knew exactly what he wanted you to know thanks to his good use of iclicker questions. My only problem with the class was the fact every assignment (once a week) was with a partner. All around, easy and well-educating class. And he podcasts. Find the book online. :  satisfied\n",
            "Professor Cao teaches the material well and allows the students ample time to discuss questions amongst themselves. The course material was easy in itself so it's hard to say how much he really helped me. The one thing I really liked about him was how he made an effort to talk to students outside the class. Great professor! :  satisfied\n",
            "Gives a lot of discussion time :  happy\n",
            "Cao is an excellent, helpful, and reassuring professor.  1st midterm average was 92%, and the day the first project was due, he opened up tutor hours until midnight.  He has an accent, but is easy enough to understand.  Attendance is mandatory.  \"It's normal to become frustrated when programming.  But don't get discouraged; you can do it!\" -Cao :  satisfied\n",
            "Awesome, one of the best professor that I have ever met. His lectures are so interesting and helpful! :  satisfied\n",
            "Very good professor, very clear about what is needed for the students to get good grades. He always give good feedback and is very nice to students and very patient to students' questions.  :  satisfied\n"
